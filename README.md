Format converter for relativistic quantum chemistry: EXP-T -> DIRAC

This tiny program provides user-friendly way of defining geometry and basis set in relativistic quantum chemistry calculations with DIRAC [1] and EXP-T [2] program packages. NWChem-like [3] format for molecular geometry, basis sets and ECPs is employed.
